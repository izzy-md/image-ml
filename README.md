# Image Blurriness Detection - Machine Learning
This project is a test for implementing a solution to Image Blurriness Detection using tensorflowjs

## Usage
This project uses parcel, so to run this, follow these instructions for development

1. Clone the repo
2. Install parcel globally by doing `yarn global add parcel-bundler`
3. Install dependencies using `yarn`
4. Run the development server using `parcel index.html`
